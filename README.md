2048 Game

2048 is a popular puzzle game where players combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile and achieve a high score. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers. The game ends when the player successfully creates a tile with the number 2048, or when there are no more possible moves.
